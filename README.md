# Mete0rama

Weather station in a tupperware box.

It uses your home network to expose measurements that you can use however you like.

## Project structure

In this repo you'll find two folders, `mete0rama` and `mete0rama-orama`.

[**Mete0rama**](./mete0rama/) is the hardware part of the project and contains the code for your nodeMCU or other esp board. See the Readme inside for pinouts and sensors and so on.

[**Mete0rama-orama**](./mete0rama-orama) contains a (progressive) web app that you can use to see your sensors measurements.
